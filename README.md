# Hyatt-Hotels-Data-Science-Project
This repository contains a project on customer surveys from the Hyatt hotel chain. My team and I analyzed a 17 GB dataset from beginning to end. The first part consists of data cleaning and munging, the second part is on descriptive statistics and visualization, and the third part is on predictive analytics and modeling.

I took a leadership role in this project. I was responsible for designing the full template and structure. I was in charge of the the data cleaning and munging part, as well as the descriptive statistics and visualization section (see code). I also helped my team members with the linear regression and association rules steps.
